# random-quote-machine
Random Quote Machine for FreeCodeCamp

This is the first intermediate-level front end development project as part of FreeCodeCamp's front end development certification course.

- Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.
- User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
- User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

I have replicated the example CodePen.io application using entirely my own code. 
I have made a point of not using Bootstrap so that I can learn design basics without a front end framework. Future improvements include:

- Implementing responsive design (compatability with mobiles and different screen sizes)
- Improving animation and transitions 
- Optimising the JavaScript code
- Cleaning the code and reviewing best practices

This project and any future projects I create will be hosted on GitHub for learning purposes.
